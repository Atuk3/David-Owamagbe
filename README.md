Hi there, I'm Owamagbe David 👋
I am a final year student at the University of Plymouth, studying Computer Science (Cyber Security). My passion lies in Cyber Security and Web development, and I enjoy exploring these fields through personal projects and academic research.

🔭 Current Projects
I am currently working on several projects related to Cyber Security and Web development. These projects include:

A malware detection tool for Windows portable executable files using machine learning techniques.
A web application for secure file sharing using cryptographic algorithms.
A website for a farm business to shop online and manage sales using a full-stack web development approach.
🌱 Learning
As a lifelong learner, I am always seeking to expand my knowledge and skills. Some of the technologies and tools that I am currently learning or planning to learn include:

Python frameworks such as Flask and Django for web development.
Cloud computing platforms such as AWS and Azure for scalability and reliability.
Tools and techniques for penetration testing and vulnerability assessments.
